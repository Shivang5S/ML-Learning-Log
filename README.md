# ML-Learning-Log
This is my Learning Log while I complete a course for Machine Learning Specialization.

I am doing the Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization Course on Coursera. Starting on 15th May '25.
It comprises of 3 courses wiz. Supervised Machine Learning, Advanced Learning Algorithms, and Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning.

In this repository, I am only including my learning status and course progress updates. This repo does not contain any code files, only Markdowns.


Cheers! Keep it up!
